InSAR Datasets
==============

To automatically submit requests to the GACOS service, the user needs to provide 
the coordinates of the area of interest and the acquisition dates and times of 
the SAR images. We provide a set of classes to automatically retrieve the 
those information from well known InSAR datasets.

Currently, the following InSAR Datasets are supported:
   * :class:`.HyP3Dataset`
   * :class:`.LiCSARDataset`
